        Carbonara is most associated with Rome and the Lazio region, but as with so many Italian dishes, in Italy, its origin provokes much speculation and debate. Some connect it to pasta cacio e uova, a Neapolitan dish of pasta tossed with melted lard, beaten raw eggs, and cheese, as documented in Ippolito Cavalcanti's 1839 Neapolitan cookbook. Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods. Others trace it to the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944, with American GIs bringing their daily ration of eggs and bacon to local restaurants to add to the limited Italian menu. Supporting this story is the first written reference to the dish in newspaper La Stampa in 1950, describing it as a dish prized by American servicemen. Shortly after, carbonara also appears  Elizabeth David’s classic 1954 book Italian Food.

         history: """
Lasagna is one of the oldest types of pasta, originating from the region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The name "lasagna" is derived from the Greek word "lasanon," meaning chamber pot, which the Romans adapted to "lasanum" to refer to a cooking pot. Over time, the dish evolved to refer to the layered pasta dish we know today.

The modern lasagna we recognize, with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese, took shape during the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, a recipe resembling lasagna appeared in the Italian cookbook "Liber de Coquina". It became a staple in Italian cuisine, particularly in the city of Naples, where they added layers of mozzarella cheese, meat, and ragù sauce.

Today, lasagna is enjoyed globally with various regional adaptations, from vegetarian versions to rich, meat-filled variations. The classic Italian lasagna uses Bolognese sauce, béchamel, and sheets of pasta, topped with a generous layer of cheese.
